# Review of my second ludum dare

After making the painful experience from my first ludum dare, I have now also collected the second painful experience.

The Idea was to have a fast growing forest. In the forest there is a railroad with some problems. Yes, exactly, trees are growing on the railroad! You have to quickly chop down the trees, so when the train arrives, his load of TNT wont explode. The forester tool is in this case an axe, of course.

It did a lot of fun to participate and this time I achieved more then the first time, so I would consider it as a sort of success.
