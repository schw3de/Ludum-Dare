# undefined medium

[undefined medium](https://undefined-medium.com) is a free and open-source pixel grid-based monospace typeface suitable for programming, writing, and whatever else you can think of … it’s pretty undefined.

It is inspired by many 5×7 pixel grid typefaces, especially Gilles Boccon-Gibod’s [MonteCarlo](https://www.bok.net/MonteCarlo), which is unfortunately, since 2010, no longer maintained.

The 400+ character set fully supports Latin Extended-A with Western European, Central European, and South Eastern European languages.

In addition, there’s many typographic symbols, mathematical symbols, superscripts, double-spaced fractions, a copyleft symbol, and a capital sharp s character.

Thank you very much, [Toshi Omagari](http://tosche.net) and [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/), for your advice, guidance, and feedback.
